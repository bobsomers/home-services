# Home Services

A collection of Docker Compose files and Systemd Units which run on a small
home server for the purposes of providing smart home automation and network
services.

Each service is defined as both a Docker Compose file (for describing the
service components itself) as well as a Systemd Unit file for launching the
service at startup.
